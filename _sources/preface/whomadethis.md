# Who made this course?

In the 1st half of 2022, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Imaging Tech team and a cohort of imaging scientists came together to develop learning materials for napari. Specifically, these learning materials were designed for research biologists *without any Python or coding experience*, and intended to onboard said users onto napari so they could perform cell segmentation workflows using a curated set of plugins hosted on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org).  

In the spirit of the open-source community, these materials may be [updated and contributed to](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-segmentation-workshop) much like napari itself, and will likely be iterated upon as video production, plugin functionality, and the napari platform evolves over time.
