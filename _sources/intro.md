Welcome to the napari Cell Segmentation course! This ~8 hour course will walk you from onboarding to napari to completing your first segmentation workflow using napari and plugins from the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org). Although napari currently requires some coding in Python, we designed each lesson in this course for researchers with *no prior coding* experience. Whenever coding is needed, we provide detailed instructions for you to follow.
 
We want to emphasize that [napari](https://www.napari.org) itself is in the **alpha stage of development**‚Äîmeaning we are still actively experimenting with, and expanding napari's functionalities, including some core features you may have used on other analysis platforms.

:::{note} 
If you encounter any issues, check the [napari Github](https://github.com/napari/napari), the Github page for an individual plugin (linked on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/) Plugin page), [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/napari), or reach out at team@napari-hub.org.

## Overview
This course is split into 3 sections. In the **[preface](preface/landing.md)**, you‚Äôll learn about how this course came to be and find a list of resources for foundational image analysis concepts that will help you get the most out of these materials. In the **[onboarding section](onboard/landing.md)**, you‚Äôll learn more about what napari is, and be guided through installing napari and plugins on your computer. Finally in the **[workflows module](workflow/landing.md)**, you'll dig into three case studies that illustrate how to perform a cell segmentation workflow from start to finish within napari, using sample data (or your own), and various napari plugins.
