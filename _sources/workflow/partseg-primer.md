# Theory of image analysis

To fully understand the steps behind the classical segmentation pathway, one has to understand some general algorithms commonly used in image analysis. We've provided these resources to help you understand the theory, as you work through [performing a segmentation with PartSeg](partseg-nuclei.md). 

## The concept of "filtering"

- [Chapter from Pete Bankhead’s BioImage book](https://bioimagebook.github.io/chapters/2-processing/4-filters/filters.html)
- [Interactive tutorial on kernels](https://www.olympus-lifescience.com/en/microscope-resource/primer/java/digitalimaging/processing/convolutionkernels/)
- [An alternative tutorial on kernels](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)

## The concept of "thresholding"
