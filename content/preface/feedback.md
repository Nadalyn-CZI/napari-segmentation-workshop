# Feedback and contributing

We see this napari segmentation course as belonging to the greater image tech ecosystem, and [we welcome any and all feedback](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-segmentation-workshop), even contributions as you make your way through these stages and lessons. We intend these learning materials to be reproducible, and adaptable, much like napari itself.
