## Introduction to napari's Python requirements

Like every software package out there, napari is written with a programming language. For example, Windows is based in *C*, various statistics programs are written in *R*, and ImageJ is based on *Java*. Napari is written with a language called *Python*. 

Python is a widely popular scientific computing language with many years of contributions under its belt. As such, there are multitudes of tools (and algorithms) that a program like napari can leverage to accomplish its tasks. Python, by default, is not pre-installed on most computers, and one needs to manually install it in order to execute Python-based programs.  

Although this is likely to change in the future, there is no ‚Äúquick install‚Äù of napari (and its requisite Python coding language). Here we walk through the steps necessary for doing so, including getting Python installed on your machine, and subsequently the individual commands necessary for installing napari itself. This particular tutorial will focus on installing the aforementioned on a Windows machine. 

## Installation of Python via an environment manager

To be clear, there are several ways one could install Python on your machine. For example, one could visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/) to install solely the Python language itself. However, installation through something known as an **environment manager**, will be quite helpful as we both install, and then utilize a program like napari, particularly because it‚Äôs a program early in its development, with many evolving parts.  

The environment manager we‚Äôll detail below is through a distribution called ‚Äúminiconda‚Äù‚Äîa lightweight distribution of the Python coding language along with a few essential packages. It will also enable us to later install napari into what is known as a **virtual environment**. Technically, it is also a **package manager**, but we‚Äôll discuss that in a bit. 

The concept of a virtual environment can be understood as a contained place, or sandbox, where both a program and its various dependencies (other related files required for elements of a program to run) are installed. This is extremely helpful, especially for programs in active development, as environments can be created and deleted at will (if for example, there was a corruption, or bug that was hard to track down).

## Steps to install miniconda

- Visit the official [conda site](conda.io).
- Locate the link for miniconda.

- Select the appropriate Miniconda installation for your computer (in this case, it is highlighted as a Windows 64-bit installation).

:::{hint} 
Note the current version of Python that will be installed also. Below, this is listed as ‚ÄúPython 3.9.7‚Äù.  Typically, if one wants a previous version of Python installed, alternative links will be available further down on the page.

:::{note} 
**Key Point**: We will be installing napari into its own virtual environment. One could have more than one virtual environment with napari installed into each, in the case it had different versions, dependency requirements, etc (or for other programs, for example). The environment manager (in this case miniconda), manages these environments for you.
:::

- Once the download has finished, run it. Default installation options are typically sufficient.
- This can be found by clicking on the lower left windows icon (Windows 10) and either typing **‚Äúanaconda‚Ä¶‚Äù** (in which case it will find "**Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)"**), or scrolling down to the anaconda folder and finding it.

- This launches the command prompt into the **‚Äúbase environment‚Äù** (as denoted by **‚Äú(base)‚Äù** at the start of the command line). This is not the virtual environment yet, as we haven‚Äôt created one, and as such, is not the environment we‚Äôll be installing napari into.

:::{hint} 
If you plan on running napari on a regular basis, it may be handy at this point to create a shortcut to the Anaconda Prompt, or pin it to your taskbar, for easy access.
